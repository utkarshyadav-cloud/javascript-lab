# Lab 8: Inheritance, Methods and Composition

## Student Information
- **Student Name:** Utkarsh Yadav
- **Student Id:** BCS2025381
- **Roll Number:** 2510303537
- **Course:** B.Tech CSE (Second Year)
- **Subject:** JavaScript Programming Lab (BCS354)
- **University:** Invertis University, Bareilly

## 1. Aim of the Experiment
To implement class inheritance using ES6 `extends` and `super`, method definitions for state validation, and object composition (has-a relationships) in JavaScript.

---

## 2. Concepts Covered
- Class inheritance with `extends` keyword and invoking parent constructor via `super()`.
- Method overriding in derived classes.
- Instance methods and state verification (PIN validation).
- Object composition pattern ("has-a" relationship) vs. inheritance ("is-a" relationship).

---

## 3. Task-wise Description
- **Task 1 (`Task1.js`):** Create class `Person` with a `greet()` method. Create class `Teacher` extending `Person` with property `subject`. Instantiate Anita teaching Maths and output her greeting.
- **Task 2 (`Task2.js`):** Create class `Locker` with default PIN `1234`. Implement `checkPin(number)` returning `true` if matched, otherwise `false`. Print results for PINs `1111` and `1234`.
- **Task 3 (`Task3.js`):** Create class `Engine` storing `power`. Create class `Car` that contains an `Engine` instance. Instantiate `Car` with power `150` and implement `start()` returning `"Car starts with 150 HP"`.

## 4. List of Files
- `Task1.js`: Inheritance and method override script.
- `Task2.js`: Method validation script.
- `Task3.js`: Object composition script.
- `README.md`: Lab documentation.
- `images/`: Directory reserved for output screenshots.

---

## 5. How to Run the Programs
Execute using Node.js:
```bash
node Task1.js
node Task2.js
node Task3.js
```

---

## 6. Expected Output

### Task 1:
```text
Hello, my name is Anita and I teach Maths
```

### Task 2:
```text
false
true
```

### Task 3:
```text
Car starts with 150 HP
```
