## 1. Aim of the Experiment
To master asynchronous JavaScript programming utilizing ES6 `Promise` (creation, fulfillment, and rejection handling via `.then()` and `.catch()`) and ES8 `async`/`await` syntactic sugar with `try...catch` error propagation, working with local mock data.

---

## 2. Concepts Covered
- Creating Promises using the `new Promise((resolve, reject) => ...)` constructor.
- Chaining fulfillment with `.then()` and catching rejection errors with `.catch()`.
- Modern asynchronous control flow using `async` functions and the `await` keyword.
- Structured asynchronous error handling using standard `try...catch` statements.
- Simulating asynchronous data retrieval using local datasets without external API dependencies.

---

## 3. Task-wise Description
- **Task 1 (`Task1.js`):** Implement `checkMarks(marks)` returning a Promise that resolves `marks` if between 0 and 100, and rejects with `Error("Marks out of range")` otherwise. Call with `80` and log the resolved value.
- **Task 2 (`Task2.js`):** Call `checkMarks(120)` and handle the rejection using `.catch()`, printing the rejection error message `"Marks out of range"`.
- **Task 3 (`Task3.js`):** Implement an async function `run()`. Inside `try`, await `checkMarks(65)` and log it, then await `checkMarks(-5)`. In `catch`, catch the error and print `"Caught: " + error.message`. Call `run()`.
- **Task 4 (`Task4.js`):** Implement `getUsers()` returning a Promise that resolves after 100 milliseconds with local objects: Asha (id 1), Rohan (id 2), and Meera (id 3). Create an async function that awaits `getUsers()` and iterates through the users printing each name on a new line.
