# Lab 11: Scope and Closures

## Student Information
- **Student Name:** Utkarsh Yadav
- **Student Id:** BCS2025381

- **Course:** B.Tech CSE (Second Year)
- **Subject:** JavaScript Programming Lab (BCS354)
- **University:** Invertis University, Bareilly

## 1. Aim of the Experiment
To investigate variable scope hierarchies (global scope, block scope, and function scope) and master lexical closures in JavaScript.

---

## 2. Concepts Covered
- Block scoping (`{ ... }`) introduced by ES6 `let` and `const`.
- Variable shadowing within nested blocks.
- Lexical scoping and closure mechanics: functions maintaining access to their outer lexical environment even after the outer function has returned.
- Global scope accessibility across function calls.

---

## 3. Task-wise Description
- **Task 1 (`Task1.js`):** Declare `level = "outer"`. Inside a nested block, declare another `level = "inner"`. Print `inner` from inside the block, then print `outer` from after the block.
- **Task 2 (`Task2.js`):** Implement `makeCounter()`, initializing `count = 0`. Return an inner function that increments and returns `count`. Call the counter twice and print both returned values.
- **Task 3 (`Task3.js`):** Declare global variable `school = "Sample College"`. Create function `showSchool()` that accesses the global variable and prints `"Welcome to Sample College"`. Call the function.

## 4. List of Files
- `Task1.js`: Block scoping script.
- `Task2.js`: Closure counter script.
- `Task3.js`: Global scope access script.
- `README.md`: Lab documentation.
- `images/`: Directory reserved for output screenshots.

---

## 5. How to Run the Programs
Execute using Node.js:
```bash
node Task1.js
node Task2.js
node Task3.js
```

---

## 6. Expected Output

### Task 1:
```text
inner
outer
```

### Task 2:
```text
1
2
```

### Task 3:
```text
Welcome to Sample College
```

## 7. Screenshot Placeholder Instructions
> **Note for Student:**
> Run each script in your terminal and take a screenshot showing the output. Save the screenshots inside the `images/` directory of this lab.
