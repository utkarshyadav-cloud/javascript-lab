# Lab 12: Callbacks and Higher-Order Functions

## Student Information
- **Student Name:** Utkarsh Yadav
- **Student Id:** BCS2025381
- **Roll Number:** 2510303537
- **Course:** B.Tech CSE (Second Year)
- **Subject:** JavaScript Programming Lab (BCS354)
- **University:** Invertis University, Bareilly

## 1. Aim of the Experiment
To understand the concept of First-Class Functions in JavaScript, creating Higher-Order Functions (functions that accept other functions as arguments), and employing callback functions for composition and iteration.

---

## 2. Concepts Covered
- Functions as first-class citizens in JavaScript.
- Higher-Order Functions (HOFs).
- Callback invocation and passing arguments to callbacks.
- Function composition using repetitive application (`fn(fn(x))`).

---

## 3. Task-wise Description
- **Task 1 (`Task1.js`):** Create `applyTwice(fn, value)` which evaluates `fn(fn(value))`. Create `addTen(num)` that adds 10. Call and print `applyTwice(addTen, 5)` to obtain `25`.
- **Task 2 (`Task2.js`):** Create `formatMarks(marks, callback)` where the callback receives `marks` and formats the string. Pass an arrow callback returning `"Marks: 76/100"` and print the output.
- **Task 3 (`Task3.js`):** Create `repeatAction(times, action)` which invokes the `action` callback for each round from 1 through `times`. Call `repeatAction(3, ...)` to output "Round 1", "Round 2", and "Round 3".

---

## 4. List of Files
- `Task1.js`: Higher-order function composition script.
- `Task2.js`: Callback formatting script.
- `Task3.js`: Repetitive callback execution script.
- `README.md`: Lab documentation.
- `images/`: Directory reserved for output screenshots.

---

## 5. How to Run the Programs
Execute using Node.js:
```bash
node Task1.js
node Task2.js
node Task3.js
```

---

## 6. Expected Output

### Task 1:
```text
25
```

### Task 2:
```text
Marks: 76/100
```

### Task 3:
```text
Round 1
Round 2
Round 3
```

## 7. Screenshot Placeholder Instructions
> **Note for Student:**
> Run each script in your terminal and take a screenshot showing the output. Save the screenshots inside the `images/` directory of this lab.
